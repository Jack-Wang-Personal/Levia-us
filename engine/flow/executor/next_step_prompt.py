def next_step_prompt(plan, current_step, context):
    prompt_template = f"""You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a workflow and determining if the current step can proceed based on available information. Your goal is to ensure all required arguments are present and to evaluate the necessity and availability of optional arguments.

Here is the complete workflow you'll be working with:
<workflow>
{str(plan)}
</workflow>

The next step to be executed is:
<current_step>
{str(current_step)}
</current_step>

The current context, which may include input and previous outputs, is:
<context>
{str(context)}
</context>

Please follow these steps to analyze the current situation:

1. Extract Arguments:
   - List all required and optional arguments for the current step.
   - Determine which arguments are provided from the input and previous outputs.

2. Validate Arguments:
   - For each required argument, confirm if it is satisfied and note its source.
   - For each optional argument, evaluate if it's needed and if it can be derived from the context.

3. Determine Source and Method:
   For each argument, note:
   - Source: 
     * "context" if the value is generated from the context
     * The previous step number if the value is from a previous step's output, then source is value "step" in last step
   - Method:
     * "LLM" if the value is generated by LLM or needs LLM processing from context or previous steps
     * If the value can be transferred directly from the output of the previous steps, use "direct"
     * If the value requires coding, provide the dictionary of exact Python code, e.g., `{{method_parameter: output_1['key']}}` (where 1 is the step number)
      method example:
        step 1 output: 
        {[{'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-02-21-25/index.html', 'content': 'February 21, 2025: Trump fires top U.S. general in unprecedented military leadership purge.'}, {'url': 'https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-taiwan-ukraine-russia-6c0cc111c1442e732c5a718c13e2df79', 'content': 'Trump abruptly reverses U.S. policy on Ukraine, raising concerns about implications for China-Taiwan relations (4 hours old).'}, {'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/22/donald-trump-announces-second-round-of-ukraine-peace-talks-with-russian-diplomats', 'content': 'Trump announces second round of Ukraine-Russia peace talks, causing European allies to rally behind Zelenskyy (2 days old).'}]}
        step 2 input is a url list, then method should be: `{{method_parameter: [item['url'] for item in output_1]}}`

  important: source and method are required and only have 3 types: 'context', 'LLM', 'direct' and 'dictionary of {{method_parameter : code}}'.

4. Prepare Response:
   Based on your analysis, prepare a JSON response in one of the following formats:

   If all required arguments are present and no critical information is missing:
   ```json
   {{
     "step": "<current step number>",
     "can_proceed": true,
     "extracted_arguments": {{
       "required_arguments": {{
         "<argument-name>": {{"source": "<source_of_the_value>", "method": "<method_to_get_the_value>", "value": "<value>"}},
         "<argument-name>": {{"source": "<source_of_the_value>", "method": "<method_to_get_the_value>", "value": "<value>"}},
         ...
       }}
     }}
   }}
   ```

   If the step cannot proceed:
   ```json
   {{
     "step": "<current step number>",
     "can_proceed": false,
     "missing_required_arguments": ["<list of missing required arguments>"],
     "needed_optional_arguments": ["<list of optional arguments that are required>"],
     "remarks": "<natural language explanation if applicable>"
   }}
   ```

Before providing your final JSON output, please conduct a thorough analysis of the arguments. Conduct this analysis inside <workflow_step_analysis> tags. In this analysis:
1. List all arguments (required and optional) from the current step.
2. For each argument:
   a. Identify its corresponding value from the context or previous steps.
   b. State whether it's satisfied (for required arguments) or needed (for optional arguments).
   c. Specify its source (context, input, or previous step number).
   d. Explicitly state the method for obtaining the argument, including Python code snippets when applicable.
   e. Provide a brief explanation of your decision-making process for this argument.
3. Summarize your findings, including:
   a. Which required arguments are satisfied and which are missing.
   b. Which optional arguments are needed and available, and which are missing but necessary.
   c. Your overall assessment of whether the step can proceed.

It's OK for this section to be quite long, as a thorough analysis is crucial for determining if the step can proceed.

After completing your analysis, provide the appropriate JSON output based on your findings.
