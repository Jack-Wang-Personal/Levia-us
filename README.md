# Levia Protocol ([Levia.us](https://levia.us/))

Levia is an Open Source AI Metacognition & Tooling infrastructure enabling agents to recursively self-learn & optimize execution pathways (think DeepSeek R1 but instead of telling users what to do, Levia roll up sleeves and execute for user).
By integrating tools and information pipelines built by its network of contributors, Levia creates a dynamic environment where agents effectively utilize real-world tools (aka **_Conductors_**). The protocol features a unique memory system that learns and improves autonomously through interaction and feedback.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- End to End Tool Integration: Wide variety of plugins, adapters, and API functions that enables conductors to perform actions on behalf of users and use computers, rather than telling users what to do
- Metacognition: Continuous reasoning and awareness stream
- Neuromorphic Memory Management: Hierarchical and segmented memory architecture  
- Custom Query Interfaces: Support for multi-modal queries and intent understanding

### Developer Benefits

- Shared Capability Network: Access and orchestrate a growing network of tools with 100+ pre-integrated.
- Transparency: Stream reasoning and execution traces for monitoring and future optimization.
- Low Code Intent Understanding: Effortless interpretation and execution of user requests.
- Simplified Pipeline Management: Abstract away pipeline upgrades, fine-tuning, and evolution, we handle that for you.

### Advantages Over Traditional Frameworks

| Current Frameworks | Levia Protocol |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Difficult tool/plugin integration | Standardized formats and validation for easy integration; autonomous tool creation through self-learning |
| Siloed runtime environments | Shared, continuously optimized workflows between agents |
| Insecure key management | Mock key calls prevent LLM leakage |

### Potential Applications

- Proactive Personal Assistance: Suggest plans without human asking for it, such as suggesting last minute valentine gifts when you struggle to come up with ideas while web scrolling.
- Boring Task Handler: can we have voice call agents that help ask for insurance claim, government fine appeals, airlines rebooking --  all corporate inefficiencies imposed on people that don't improve coz of some bureaucracy, now Levia provide a way to bypass that for us
- Headless executors: Serve responses and execute tasks directly through Levia without needing to go through 50 different apps, yep, aka intents!
- Dynamic Knowledge Tree: "Everpedia" agents aware of social trends with continuous knowledge updates, such as the latest DOGE policies, tax policies, how to claim benefits etc and suggest how to maximize benefits for you
- More....: What if you get a personal negotiator (automatically handles disputes based on your latest google meets, negotiates bills & optimizes your budget in real-time), personal finance optimizer (from tracking and cancelling your random $0.99 subscriptions that hasn't been used in 2 years to spotting non-essential goods that are costly), personal daily briefer (waking up to your own information aggregator across social medias, tone tailored so precisely it feels like a dialogue between you & the world) 

## Architecture

Levia's architecture mirrors human cognitive processes. Its shared memory and capability network expand with each new agent, pioneering human-like AI systems en route to sovereign AGI.
