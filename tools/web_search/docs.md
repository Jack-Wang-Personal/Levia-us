**Identified Functions:**
- `web_search`

**Function Details:**

1. **Function Name:** `web_search`

   - **Function Signature:** `def web_search(intent: str):`
   
   - **Parameters:**
     - `intent` (str): The intent of the user.
   
   - **Return Value:**
     - Returns either a string (`"No results found."`) or a list of URLs (`relevance_urls`). The exact type of `relevance_urls` is assumed to be a list of strings based on context, but this isn't explicitly confirmed in the code.
   
   - **Function Purpose:**
     - Searches the web for information based on the user's intent and returns a list of relevant URLs.
   
   - **Notable Aspects:**
     - Utilizes the `Aipolabs` API for performing web searches.
     - Handles exceptions during the search process and logs errors without halting execution.
     - If no content is found, it returns a message indicating no results.
     - Uses helper functions like `generate_search_keywords`, `aipolabs_search`, and `extract_relevance_url` to process the search.
   
   - **Edge Cases & Potential Issues:**
     - If the `AIPOLABS_API_KEY` environment variable is not set, the `Aipolabs` client initialization may fail.
     - The function assumes that `relevance_urls` is a list of URLs, but if `extract_relevance_url` returns a different structure, it might cause inconsistencies.
     - If `generate_search_keywords` returns an empty list, the search loop will be skipped, potentially leading to no results even if relevant information exists.
