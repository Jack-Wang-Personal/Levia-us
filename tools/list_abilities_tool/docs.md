Functions identified with @simple_tool decorator:
1. list_abilities()

Analysis of list_abilities():
- Function signature: def list_abilities()
- Parameters: None
- Return value: List of dictionaries containing method names and descriptions
- Purpose: Scans through the tools directory to find all available abilities/tools by reading docs.md files
- Implementation details:
  * Uses os.walk to traverse through directories
  * Looks for docs.md files
  * Extracts JSON content from these files
  * Creates a list of abilities with their methods and descriptions
- Notable aspects:
  * Error handling for JSON decode errors
  * Uses UTF-8 encoding for file reading
  * Relies on external docs.md files for information
- Edge cases:
  * Handles potential JSON parsing errors
  * Handles general exceptions during file processing
  * Continues processing even if one file fails

  "functions": [
    {
      "method": "list_abilities",
      "short_description": "List all available tools and abilities from the system",
      "detailed_description": "Scans through the tools directory structure, reads docs.md files, and extracts information about all available tools and abilities. The function processes JSON content within the documentation files to compile a comprehensive list of available methods and their descriptions.",
      "inputs": [],
      "output": {
        "description": "Returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about an available tool/ability, including its method name and description",

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The analysis reveals one function decorated with @simple_tool. The function list_abilities() is a utility function that helps discover and catalog all available tools in the system by reading documentation files. It doesn't take any parameters but returns a structured list of abilities found in the system. The implementation includes robust error handling and continues processing even if individual files fail to parse.
