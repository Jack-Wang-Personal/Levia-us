    You will be given a userâ€™s input as a string. Your task is to extract the most appropriate search keywords based on the given input. The output should be a list of keywords, and you should generate as few keywords as possible while ensuring they are concise and accurately reflect the user's need. 

    The keywords may consist of multiple related terms, but avoid unnecessary or redundant words.

    Examples:

    1. Input: The user wants to learn how to use MySQL.
    Output: ["SQL usage guide"]


    2. Input: The user wants to know about the economic trends in China for 2025.
    Output: ["2025 China economic forecast"]


    3. Input: The user wants to learn how to analyze data with Python.
    Output: ["Python data analysis"]


    4. Input: The user wants to learn how to improve work efficiency.
    Output: ["work efficiency"]


    5. Input: The user wants to know about stock market trends and investment advice for 2025 in the U.S.
    Output: ["2025 U.S. stock market trends"]


    Your task:
    - Extract only the most relevant and minimal keywords from the input.
    - The keywords should accurately reflect the search query, and as few keywords as necessary to do so.
    - Ensure clarity and avoid redundancy.
    - The output should be only the keywords, no other text.
