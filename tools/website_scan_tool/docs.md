**Identified Functions:**
- `website_scan`
- `main`

**Function Analysis:**

1. **Function Name:** `website_scan`
   
   **Function Signature:**
   ```python
   @simple_tool("Website Scan Tool")
   def website_scan(urls: list, intent: str):
   ```

   **Parameters:**
   - `urls: list`
     - **Type:** `list`
     - **Required:** Yes
     - **Description:** A list of URLs to be scanned.
   - `intent: str`
     - **Type:** `str`
     - **Required:** Yes
     - **Description:** The intent or purpose guiding the scanning process.

   **Return Value:**
   - **Description:** Summary of the scanned links based on the provided intent.
   - **Type:** Likely a dictionary or a structured data type containing the summary results.

   **Function Purpose:**
   The `website_scan` function scans a list of websites, processes the links based on a specified intent, retrieves their content, and summarizes the links accordingly.

   **Notable Implementation Aspects:**
   - Utilizes several utility functions to process links:
     - `get_all_links`: Retrieves all links from the provided URLs.
     - `remove_duplicate_links`: Eliminates any duplicate links from the list.
     - `get_prompt_links`: Filters or processes links based on the given intent.
     - `get_all_content`: Fetches the content from the processed links.
     - `get_summary_links`: Generates a summary of the links based on the intent.
   - Decorated with `@simple_tool("Website Scan Tool")`, indicating it's intended to be recognized as a simple tool within the framework.

   **Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**
   - **Empty `urls` List:** If an empty list is provided, the function may return an empty summary or encounter errors if not handled within the utility functions.
   - **Invalid URLs:** Malformed or unreachable URLs could cause the utility functions to fail or skip processing.
   - **Large Number of URLs:** Processing a very large list of URLs might lead to performance issues or consume significant resources.
   - **Ambiguous Intent:** If the `intent` provided doesn't clearly specify the desired processing, the results might be suboptimal or not as expected.
   - **Dependency on External Modules:** Relies on external modules and utility functions; any issues or changes in those can affect the functionality.

2. **Function Name:** `main`
   
   **Function Signature:**
   ```python
   def main():
   ```

   **Parameters:**
   - None

   **Return Value:**
   - **Description:** None (implicitly returns `None`).
   - **Type:** `NoneType`

   **Function Purpose:**
   The `main` function initializes the `website_scan` tool and executes it using the `ToolRunner`.

   **Notable Implementation Aspects:**
   - Creates an instance of the `website_scan` tool.
   - Initializes a `ToolRunner` with the tool and runs it.
   - Acts as the entry point of the script when executed directly.

   **Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**
   - **Missing Decorated Functions:** If no functions are decorated with `@simple_tool`, `website_scan` might not function as intended.
   - **Tool Initialization Failures:** If `website_scan` fails to initialize or run, the `ToolRunner` may encounter errors.
   - **No Command-Line Arguments:** Since `main` doesn't handle any command-line inputs, it's limited to predefined behaviors unless modified.
