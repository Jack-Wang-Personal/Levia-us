1. Identified functions:
   - website_scan (method of WebsiteScanTool class decorated via class-level @run_tool)

2. Analysis of website_scan:
   a. Function signature: 
      def website_scan(self, url_list: list, intent: str)
   
   b. Parameters:
      - url_list: list (required), list of URLs to scan
      - intent: str (required), guides scanning focus
   
   c. Return value: 
      - result (type not explicitly shown but implied to be processed content)
      - Based on context, likely returns list/dict of summarized information
   
   d. Purpose:
      - Orchestrates website scanning pipeline: link collection, deduplication, intent-based filtering, content extraction, and summarization
   
   e. Notable aspects:
      - Relies on external utils functions (get_all_links, get_summary_links etc.)
      - No visible error handling for network requests or invalid URLs
      - Sequential processing with multiple data transformation steps
   
   f. Potential issues:
      - No validation for URL format in url_list
      - No timeout handling for get_all_content
      - Dependency on external utils that aren't shown in code
      - Return type depends on get_summary_links implementation
